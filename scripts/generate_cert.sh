# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
#   /etc/letsencrypt/live/containers.page/fullchain.pem
#   Your key file has been saved at:
#   /etc/letsencrypt/live/containers.page/privkey.pem
#   Your cert will expire on 2019-09-04. To obtain a new or tweaked
#   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
#   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
#   "certbot renew"
# - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
#   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
#   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
#   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
#   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
# - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

#   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
#   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

# Since the containers expect these files to be in /etc/ssl, copy there
# This CANNOT be a link.
