# Installation: Web Server and Storage

Before doing `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers, there are some specific things that need to be set up.

## Under Maintenance Page

If it's ever the case that the Docker images need to be brought down for maintenance, a static fallback page should be available to notify the user. If you noticed in the [prepare_instance.sh](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/scripts/prepare_instance.sh) script, one of the things we installed is nginx (on the instance). This is because we need to use it to get proper certificates for our domain (for https). Before you do this, you might want to copy the index that we've provided to replace the default (some lame page that says welcome to Nginx!) to one that you can show when the server is undergoing maintainance.

```bash
cp $INSTALL_ROOT/sregistry/scripts/nginx-index.html /var/www/html/index.html
rm /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
```

If you want your page to use the same SSL certificates, a nginx-default.conf is also
provided that will point to the same certificates on the server (generation discussed later).
Please execute this command only after the certificates have been generated, or you won't be able to generate them:

```bash
cp $INSTALL_ROOT/sregistry/scripts/nginx-default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

If you don't care about user experience during updates and server downtime, you can just ignore this.

## Custom Domain

In the [config settings file](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/shub/settings/config.py#L30)
you'll find a section for domain names, and other metadata about your registry. You will need to update
this to be a custom hostname that you use, and custom names and unique resource identifiers for your
registry. For example, if you have a Google Domain and are using Google Cloud, you should be able to set it up using [Cloud DNS](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/dns/api/enable?nextPath=%2Fzones&project=singularity-static-registry&authuser=1). Usually this means
creating a zone for your instance, adding a Google Domain, and copying the DNS records for
the domain into Google Domains. Sometimes it can take a few days for changes to propogate.
You are strongly encouraged to register both `your.domain.com`, as well as `www.your.domain.com` and have them point to the same IP address.
We will discuss setting up https in a later section.

## Storage

For Singularity Registry versions prior to 1.1.24, containers that were uploaded to your registry
were stored on the filesystem, specifically at `/var/www/images` that was bound to the host
at `images`. We did this by way of using a custom nginx image with the nginx upload module
enabled (see [this post](https://vsoch.github.io/2018/django-nginx-upload/) for an example).

There is also the other option to use [custom builders]({{ site.url }}/install-builders) 
that can be used to push a recipe to Singularity Registry Server, and then trigger a 
cloud build that will be saved in some matching cloud storage.

### Default

However for versions 1.1.24 and later, to better handle the Singularity `library://`
client that uses Amazon S3, we added a [Minio Storage](https://docs.min.io/docs/python-client-api-reference.html#presigned_get_object) 
backend, or another container (minio) that is deployed alongside Singularity Registry server.
If you look in the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) that looks something like this:

```
minio:
  image: minio/minio
  volumes:
    - ./minio-images:/images
  env_file:
   - ./.minio-env
  ports:
   - "9000:9000"  
  command: ["server", "images"]
```


At the time of development we are using this version of minio:

```
/ # minio --version
minio version RELEASE.2020-04-02T21-34-49Z
```

which you can set in the docker-compose.yml file to pin it. Notice that we bind the
folder "minio-images" in the present working directory to /images in the container,
which is where we are telling minio to write images to the filesystem. This means
that if your container goes away, the image files will still be present on the host.
For example, after pushing two images, I can see them organized by bucket, collection,
then container name with hash.

```
$ tree minio-images/
minio-images/
└── sregistry
    └── test
        ├── big:sha256.92278b7c046c0acf0952b3e1663b8abb819c260e8a96705bad90833d87ca0874
        └── container:sha256.c8dea5eb23dec3c53130fabea451703609478d7d75a8aec0fec238770fd5be6e
```

### Configuration
For secrets (the access and secret key that are used to create the container) 
we are reading in environment variables for the server in `.minio-env`
that looks like this:

```bash
# Credentials (change the first two)
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=newminio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=newminio123
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_OLD=minio
MINIO_SECRET_KEY_OLD=minio123

# Turn on/off the Minio browser at 127.0.0.1:9000?
MINIO_BROWSER=on

# Don't clean up images in Minio that are no longer referenced by sregistry
DISABLE_MINIO_CLEANUP = False
```

If you [read about how minio is configured](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/config)
you will notice that since the container was built previously with the default credentials,
to change them we are required to define the same variables with `*_OLD` suffix. This
means that you should be able to keep the last two lines (minio and minio123, respectively)
and change the first two to your new access key and secret. And if it's not clear:

> **You should obviously change the access key and secret in the minio-env file!**

The `.minio-env` file is also bound to the uwsgi container, so that the generation of the minio
storage can be authenticated by the uwsgi container, which is the interface between
the Singularity client and minio. For variables that aren't secrets, you can look
in `shub/settings/config.py` and look for the "Storage" section with various
minio variables:

```python
MINIO_SERVER = "minio:9000"  # Internal to sregistry
MINIO_EXTERNAL_SERVER = (
    "127.0.0.1:9000"  # minio server for Singularity to interact with
)
MINIO_BUCKET = "sregistry"
MINIO_SSL = False  # use SSL for minio
MINIO_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 5
MINIO_REGION = "us-east-1"
MINIO_MULTIPART_UPLOAD = True
```

Since the container networking space is different from what the external
Singularity client interacts with, we define them both here. If you deploy
a minio server external to the docker-compose.yml, you can update both of
these URLs to be the url to access it. The number of minutes for the signed
url to expire applies to single PUT (upload), GET (download), and upload Part (PUT) requests.
Finally, the logs that you see with `docker-compose logs minio` are fairly limited,
it's recommended to install the client [mc](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide)
to better inspect:

```bash
wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
chmod +x mc
./mc --help
```

You'll still need to add the host manually:

```bash
./mc config host add myminio http://127.0.0.1:9000 $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY $MINIO_SECRET_KEY
Added `myminio` successfully.
```

You can then list the hosts that are known as follows (and make sure yours appears)

```bash
/ # ./mc config host ls
gcs  
  URL       : https://storage.googleapis.com
  AccessKey : YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE
  SecretKey : YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE
  API       : S3v2
  Lookup    : dns

local
  URL       : http://localhost:9000
  AccessKey : 
  SecretKey : 
  API       : 
  Lookup    : auto

myminio
  URL       : https://127.0.0.1:9000
  AccessKey : YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE
  SecretKey : YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE
  API       : S3v4
  Lookup    : auto


play 
  URL       : https://play.min.io
  AccessKey : YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE
  SecretKey : YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE
  API       : S3v4
  Lookup    : auto

s3   
  URL       : https://s3.amazonaws.com
  AccessKey : YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE
  SecretKey : YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE
  API       : S3v4
  Lookup    : dns
```

And then getting logs like this:

```bash
./mc admin trace -v myminio
```

When the trace is running, you should be able to do some operation and see output.
(It will just hang there open while it's waiting for you to try a push).
This is really helpful for debugging!

```
The above shows an error - the signature is somehow wrong. It came down to not specifying the signature type in a config
when I instantiated the client, and also needing to customize the `presign_v4` function to allowing
sending along the sha256sum from the scs-library-client (it was using an unsigned hash).
For other configuration settings (cache, region, notifications) you should consult
the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/config).
SSL instructions for minio are included in the next section.

## SSL

### Server Certificates

Getting https certificates is really annoying, and getting `dhparams.pem` takes forever. But after the domain is obtained, it's important to do. Again, remember that we are working on the host, and we have an nginx server running. You should follow the instructions (and I do this manually) in [generate_cert.sh](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/scripts/generate_cert.sh). 

 - starting nginx
 - installing certbot
 - generating certificates
 - linking them to where the docker-compose expects them
 - add a reminder or some other method to renew within 89 days

With certbot, you should be able to run `certbot renew` when the time to renew comes up. There is also an [older
version](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/scripts/generate_cert_tiny-acme.sh) that uses tiny-acme instead of certbot. For this second option, it basically comes down to:

 - starting nginx
 - installing tiny acme
 - generating certificates
 - using tinyacme to get them certified
 - moving them to where they need to be.
 - add a reminder or some other method to renew within 89 days

Once you have done this (and you are ready for https), you should use the `docker-compose.yml` and the `nginx.conf` provided in the folder [https](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/blob/master/https/). So do something like this:

```bash
mkdir http
mv nginx.conf http
mv docker-compose.yml http

cp https/docker-compose.yml .
cp https/nginx.conf.https nginx.conf
```

If you run into strange errors regarding any kind of authentication / server / nginx when you start the images, likely it has to do with not having moved these files, or a setting about https in the [settings](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/tree/master/shub/settings). If you have trouble, please post an issue on the [issues board](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues) and I'd be glad to help.

### Minio

Minio has detailed instructions for setting up https [here](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/tls),
and you can use existing or self signed certificates. The docker-compose.yml in the https folder takes the
strategy of binding the same SSL certs to `${HOME}/.minio/certs` in the container.
Note that inside the certs directory, the private key must by named private.key and the public key must be named public.crt.

## Build the Image (Optional)
If you want to try it, you can build the image. Note that this step isn't necessary as the image is provided on [Quay.io]({{ site.registry }}). This step is optional. However, if you are developing you likely want to build the image locally. You can do:


```bash
cd sregistry
docker build -t quay.io/vanessa/sregistry .
```

## Nginx

This section is mostly for your FYI. The nginx container that we used to rely on for uploads is a custom compiled
nginx that included the [nginx uploads module](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/upload/).
This allowed us to define a server block that would accept multipart form data directly, and 
allowed uploads directly to the server without needing to stress the uwsgi application. 
The previous image we used is still provided on Docker Hub at
[quay.io/vanessa/sregistry_nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/quay.io/vanessa/sregistry_nginx)
While we don't use this for standard uploads, we still use it for the web interface upload,
and thus have not removed it. To build this image on your own change this section:


```bash
nginx:
  restart: always
  image: quay.io/vanessa/sregistry_nginx
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
    - ./uwsgi_params.par:/etc/nginx/uwsgi_params.par:ro
  volumes_from:
    - uwsgi
  links:
    - uwsgi
    - db
``` 
to this, meaning that we will build from the nginx folder:

```bash
nginx:
  restart: always
  build: nginx
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  volumes:
    - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
    - ./uwsgi_params.par:/etc/nginx/uwsgi_params.par:ro
  volumes_from:
    - uwsgi
  links:
    - uwsgi
    - db
```

Next, why don't you [start Docker containers](containers) to get your own registry going.
